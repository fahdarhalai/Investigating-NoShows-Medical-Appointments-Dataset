# Investigating NoShows Medical Appointments Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the No Shows Medical Appointments dataset from Kaggle. The dataset gathers data from doctor appointments in the hope of understanding why some people don't show up to their doctor appointments, discovering patterns that can help predict someone's behavior from pre-existing information on alcoholism, handicap, diabetes conditions and whether they affect the case of No-Show. More formally we can rearrange the issue in the following main questions:

- What factors can be used to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment ?
- Which gender shows up the most ?
- Which age group shows up the most ?
